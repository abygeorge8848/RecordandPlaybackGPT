    The below content gives information about an XML framework named PAF. Use that information to create the PAF code for the user query  
    Some attributes for each tag will be given. If an attribute is not given then please fill the attribute value,  
    with an appropriate value according to the attribute description. In case direct PAF code is given, then you can
    directly use it along with the rest of the given input. Only return the PAF code in the correct syntax and format.

              PAF MANUAL 
              ----------
              Every set of set instructions must be enclosed in an activity tag :
              <activity id="activity_name">
               -
               -
               -
              </activity>
            
              The activity can be named anything. Simply replace the 'activity_name' in the id attribute 
              with an appropriate name which describes what the activity is doing.
              
              Now the content inside the activity tag would be the individual functionality. Each functionality
              be a simple tag like <click xpath=""></click>, <input xpath="" value=""></input> which form the
              building blocks of PAF. Now let us explore some PAF tags with their corresponding functionality.

              To do a click action :
              <click xpath="xpath_value"></click>
              Here the xpath attribute represents the xpath of the element you want to click on. 'Replace xpath_value'
              with the xpath of the respective element.

              To input some text into a textbox :
              <input xpath="xpath_value" value="value_to_be_entered">
              xpath attribute is the xpath of the textbox you want to enter your text in.
              The value attribute represents the text you want to enter in the textfield.

              To wait for a specified amount of time in ms :
              <wait time="time_in_ms"></wait>
              Where the time attribute is the time in ms.

              To wait till the page has loaded :
              <WaitForPageLoad/>

              To double click on an element :
              <dblClick xpath="xpath_value"></dblClick>
              The xpath attribute is the xpath of the element you need to double click on

              To scroll to a particular element :
              <scroll xpath="xpath_value"></scroll>
              Where xpath is the element to be scrolled to.

              To get the text of an element :
              <getText xpath="xpath_value" variable="variable_name"></getText>
              The xpath attribute represents the xpath of the element whose text is to be read.
              The variable attribute represents an appropriate name for the variable in which the text is to be 
              stored. If there are multiple variables in a single activity, each variable name must be unique.

              Sometimes, some values will be required to be saved in order to be used in other tags like
              validation, etc. This is the variable tag : 
              <variable keyName="variable_name" value="variable_value">
              Here, keyName represents an appropriate name for the variable with respect to its intent for storing
              or the content stored in it. 
              value attribute represents the value of the variable stored. When the value of another variable is to
              be called, it can be called in an attribute in the format - attribute equals dollar sign open and close curly 
              braces with the variable named enclosed in the open and closed curly braces.

              To perform validations, the validation tag is used in conjunctions with a valGroup.
              First, we need to define the appropriate valGroup which will be then referenced by the validation.
              Let us look at the various valGroups - 
                1. To validate that a certain element exists in the UI :
                   <valGroup groupId="group-id">
                      <validate xpath="xpath_value" exists="true/false" passMsg="An appropriate pass message to indicate why this is considered as a passed case" failMsg="A corresponding fail message to explain in case the condition fails">
                   </valGroup
                   groupId is an appropriate and unique name given to the valGroup     
              
                   Here xpath represents the xpath of the element we want to verify in the UI.
                   exists can be equal to true or false, depending on whether we want to check if the element exists or not in the UI.
                   passMsg should be the message in case the condition passes to explain what is being validated.
                   failMsg should be the message in case the condition fails.

              Include the valGroup outside of the <activity> ONLY. To call the valGroup within the activity, use the validation tag :
                <validation valGroupIds="group-id">
              Here, the valGroupIds must have the same group id as the vlGroup it is referencing.
